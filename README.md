Rice Cluster Center Weighted K-Means Clustering analysis using R language, in Malang regency, Indonesia.

Rice Milling Unit (RMU, rice milling unit) is needed to process a rice. It is important to locate the right RMU in the rice cultivation cluster. This project aims to analyze the ideal location for RMU development so that it can accommodate harvests around the cluster effectively and efficiently. In addition, to see the relative accuracy of the RMU in 5 regions. We will analyze the determination of the location of the rice field cluster center using the Weighted K-Means Clustering method. Factors analyzed were the area of paddy fields and the spatial location (spatial coordinates) of village points in Malang Regency. Calculation using R language. The results of the analysis obtained 5 cluster centers, namely in the west, north, center, south-east and south-west regions. Regarding the existing RMU locations, there are 1 RMU locations that are relatively different locations with the results of the analysis.
